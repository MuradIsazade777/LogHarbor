## 🔧 Features

- Fast and minimalistic Go backend using Gin
- RESTful API for log ingestion (`POST /logs`)
- Log retrieval with structured JSON output (`GET /logs`)
- In-memory storage for rapid prototyping
- Modular architecture ready for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Kafka integration
- Clean project structure for scalability and maintainability
